🛡️ Cloud-Shield: Security-as-Code Baseline
This repository provides a Hardened Security Group Baseline for AWS environments, designed to meet N8 (ANSSI) and CIS Benchmark security standards.

🚀 Why this exists
Manual network configuration is the #1 cause of data breaches. This project automates the perimeter security to ensure "Zero-Trust" by default.

🛠️ Security Features Implemented
SSH Hardening: Port 22 is restricted to specific Administrative CIDRs only.
Protocol Enforcement: Only encrypted traffic (HTTPS) is allowed.
Egress Control: Restricted outbound traffic to prevent data exfiltration.
Documentation: Every rule is mapped to a security requirement.

📈 Skills Demonstrated
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform / HCL
Network Security: Stateful Inspection, CIDR logic
Compliance: N8 Baseline & CIS Benchmarks
